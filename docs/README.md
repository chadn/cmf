-   **Concise**: High-level focus, avoiding implementation minutiae
-   **Cross-Referenced**: Links between related documents
-   **Consistent Formatting**: Standardized structure and style

## ðŸ”„ Maintenance

Documents are updated as part of the regular development workflow:

-   **Implementation changes**: Update relevant docs in same PR
-   **New features**: Document in usage.md and update todo.md
-   **Refactoring**: Create ADRs for architectural decisions, update refactor.md template
-   **Test changes**: Update tests.md coverage statistics

For historical context on major architectural decisions, see [Architecture Decision Records](adr/README.md).

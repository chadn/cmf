## Next Steps for Testing

### Priority 1: Improve Map Component Testing

1. Improve test coverage for MapContainer component (currently at 11.68%)
    - Create proper mocks for Map, Marker, and Popup components from react-map-gl
    - Test viewport changes, marker rendering, and popup functionality
    - Focus on testing user interactions with the map

### Priority 2: Complete Hook Testing

1. Create tests for useMap and useEventsManager hooks (currently at 0%)
    - Mock maplibre-gl functionality
    - Test map initialization, viewport changes, and marker management
    - Test event filtering, sorting, and date range selection logic

### Priority 3: API and Cache Testing

1. Create tests for API utilities (calendar.ts, geocoding.ts)
    - Mock fetch requests
    - Test response parsing and error handling
2. Create tests for Cache utilities (filesystem.ts, upstash.ts)
    - Mock file system and Redis interactions
    - Test caching and retrieval logic

### Priority 4: Improve Event Components Testing

1. Increase test coverage for EventList.tsx (currently at 56%)
    - Test sorting functionality
    - Test filtering behavior
    - Test pagination and scrolling
2. Create tests for ActiveFilters.tsx (currently at 0%)
    - Test filter display
    - Test filter removal

### Priority 5: App Pages Testing

1. Create tests for main app pages
    - Test page rendering and component integration
    - Test routing and navigation

## Testing Strategy

For components:

-   Test rendering with different props
-   Test user interactions
-   Test conditional rendering
-   Focus on edge cases and error states

For hooks:

-   Test initialization
-   Test state changes
-   Test error handling

For utilities:

-   Test all edge cases
-   Test error handling
-   Ensure consistent behavior across environments

For API:

-   Create mocks for external services
-   Test success and error paths

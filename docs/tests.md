## Next Steps for Testing

### Priority 1: Improve Map Component Testing

1. Improve test coverage for MapContainer component beyond basic module existence test
    - Create proper mocks for Map, Marker, and Popup components from react-map-gl
    - Test viewport changes, marker rendering, and popup functionality

### Priority 2: Complete Hook Testing

1. Create tests for useMap hook
    - Mock maplibre-gl functionality
    - Test map initialization, viewport changes, and marker management

### Priority 3: API and Cache Testing

1. Create tests for API utilities (calendar.ts, geocoding.ts)
    - Mock fetch requests
    - Test response parsing and error handling
2. Create tests for Cache utilities (filesystem.ts, upstash.ts)
    - Mock file system and Redis interactions
    - Test caching and retrieval logic

### Priority 4: App Pages Testing

1. Create tests for main app pages
    - Test page rendering and component integration
    - Test routing and navigation

## Testing Strategy

For components:

-   Test rendering with different props
-   Test user interactions
-   Test conditional rendering

For hooks:

-   Test initialization
-   Test state changes
-   Test error handling

For utilities:

-   Test all edge cases
-   Test error handling

For API:

-   Create mocks for external services
-   Test success and error paths

-   **Proposed** ü§î - Decision suggested but not yet implemented
-   **Deprecated** ‚ùå - Decision no longer valid or superseded

## Guidelines

-   Keep ADRs concise and focused on the architectural decision, not implementation details
-   Focus on **WHY** the decision was made, not HOW it was implemented
-   Include context, considered options, and consequences
-   Update status when decisions change or are superseded

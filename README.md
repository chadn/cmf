## üöÄ Getting Started

### üîë Google Calendar API Key

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project if you don't already have one.
3. Enable the Google Calendar API
4. Create an API key with appropriate restrictions
   `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events.readonly`
5. Add the API key to your `.env.local` file

### üîë Google Maps Geocoding API Key

1. In the same Google Cloud project, enable the Geocoding API
2. Create a new API key to for Geocoding API
   https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/requests-geocoding
3. Add the API key to your `.env.local` file

### üîß Installation

Clone the repository, install dependencies, and create a `.env.local` file:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/chadn/cmf.git
    cd cmf
    npm install
    cp .env.example .env.local
    ```

Add your API keys to the `.env.local` file. For details, see [.env.example](.env.example)

## History

In 2010 I had the idea to use a map to filter Calendar events, and built a similar web app.
This original version used Google Maps and Google Calendar, so it was called GCM for Google Calendar Map.
https://chadnorwood.com/projects/gcm/

Around 2015 it stopped working. 
Before 2015 Google Maps was totally free and abuse was rare. Once Google Maps started costing money I disabled GCM. 

Ever since then I considered rewriting to use free maps, and finally made it happen.

# Calendar Map Filter (CMF)

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

If you love maps, and have many events in your Calendar, this is for you.

CMF is a fast, interactive tool for exploring events on a map and in a list.
Designed for data lovers, it lets you filter by date, location, or search termâ€”and instantly see counts, numbers, and visuals update as you adjust filters.
Built for high responsiveness and clarity, CMF makes it easy to explore, analyze, and share event data.

## Status

-   Work In Progress: https://cmf.chadnorwood.com/

## ðŸŒŸ Features

-   **Event Sources System**: [Modular system](src/lib/api/eventSources/README.md) for fetching events, from Google Calendar, Facebook Events, or custom websites.
-   **Interactive Map**: Use the map to **View** and **Filter** events on a MapLibre GL map
-   **Smart Filtering**: Filter events by date range, search terms, and map bounds
-   **Sortable Event List**: Organize events by name, date, duration, or location with both primary and secondary sorting.
-   **Location Geocoding**: Automatically converts event locations to map coordinates
-   **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
-   **Performance Optimized**: Uses Redis cache, enabling < 1 second response most of time, and reduces API calls.

## ðŸ”— Tech Stack

-   **Frontend**: [React](https://reactjs.org/) - React framework with SSR (Server Side Rendering)
-   **Fullstack, Hosting**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/nextjs)
-   **Language**: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Type-safe JavaScript
-   **Map**:[MapLibre GL JS](https://maplibre.org/) - Open-source maps SDKs using OpenStreetMap Data

## History

In 2010 I had the idea to use a map to filter Calendar events, and built a similar web app.
This original version used Google Maps and Google Calendar, so it was called GCM for Google Calendar Map.
https://chadnorwood.com/projects/gcm/

Around 2015 it stopped working - Before 2015 Google Maps was totally free and abuse was rare. Once Google Maps started costing money I disabled GCM.

Ever since then I considered rewriting to use free maps, and finally made it happen.
